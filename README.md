# SCLE

## Introduction

Technology has connected us to more people than we could have imagined, and often beyond our brain power to maintain meangingful relationships with. This observation has been popularised by Dunbar's Number, an inituitive value describing this limit.

SCLE – Social Cognitive Limit Expander – is a lightweight and flexible digital way to jot down notes and record socially relevant information.

Like the trusted notebook of yesteryear, SCLE lets you quickly record and remember the small details that make your next conversations relatable and empathetic.  

Recalling details from conversations can be hard. Let's fix that.
